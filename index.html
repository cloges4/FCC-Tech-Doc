            </header>
            <h3>How are elements laid out by default?</h3>
            <p>First of all, individual element boxes are laid out by taking the elements' content, then adding any
                padding, border and
                margin around them — it's that box model thing again, which we've looked at earlier.</p>
            <p>By default, a block level element's content is 100% of the width of its parent element, and as tall
                as its content.
                Inline elements are all tall as their content, and as wide as their content. You can't set width or
                height on inline
                elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements. If you want to control the size
                of an inline
                element in this manner, you need to set it to behave like a block level element with <span
                    class="code-snippet">display: block;</span> (or even,<span
                    class="code-snippet">display:inline-block;</span>
                which mixes characteristics from both.)</p>
            <p>That explains individual elements, but what about how elements interact with one another? The normal
                layout flow
                (mentioned in the layout introduction article) is the system by which elements are placed inside the
                browser's viewport.
                By default, block-level elements are laid out in the direction that blocks display in the writing
                mode of the document —
                each one will appear on a new line below the last one, and they will be separated by any margin that
                is set on them. In
                English therefore, or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode, block-level elements are
                laid out vertically.</p>
            <p>Inline elements behave differently — they don't appear on new lines; instead, they sit on the same
                line as one another
                and any adjacent (or wrapped) text content, as long as there is space for them to do so inside the
                width of the parent
                block level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing text or elements will move down to a
                new line.</p>
            <p>If two adjacent elements both have the margin set on them and the two margins touch, the larger of
                the two remains, and
                the smaller one disappears — this is called margin collapsing, and we have met this before too.</p>
            <p>Let's look at a simple example that explains all of this:</p>
            <!-- TODO Code section only add HTML without the image -->
            <!-- TODO Code output: create a browser styled only section for this content to be displayed -->
            </header>
        </section>
        <section id="Flexbox" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Flexbox</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Why Flexbox?</h3>
            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were
                things like
                <!-- TODO Links to section -->
                <a href="">floats</a> and <a href="">positioning</a>. These are fine and they work, but in some ways
                they are also rather limiting and
                frustrating.</p>
            <p>The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools,
                in any kind of
                convenient, flexible way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height,
                    regardless of how much
                    width/height is available.</li>
                <li>Making all columns in a multiple column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a
                    different amount of content.</li>
            </ul>
